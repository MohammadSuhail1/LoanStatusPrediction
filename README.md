1  Loan Status Prediction

A loan is when one or more people, organizations, or other entities lend money to other 
people, organizations, or entities. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt for which he 
or she is generally responsible for paying interest until the loan is repaid. The project’s objective 
is to ensure that a person, institution, or organization applying for a loan is verified thoroughly 
before sanctioning them a loan. Several criteria like gender, education, number of dependents, 
to name a few, have to be taken into consideration before approving the loan. The project aims 
at automating the procedure, thus, helping in reducing the time and energy and making the 
process more efficient. Two sets of data – train data set and test data set – are given as the 
input. The train data set is used to train the Machine Learning Model and determine its 
accuracy. The test data set is used to output the loan eligibility predictions.

2 Problem Statement

Banks, Housing Finance Companies, and some NBFC deal in various types of loans like housing 
loans, personal loans, business loans, etc in all over the part of countries. These companies 
have existence in Rural, Semi-Urban, and Urban areas. After applying for a loan by a customer 
these companies validate the eligibility of customers to get the loan or not. This project 
provides a solution to automate this process by employing a machine learning algorithm. So the 
customer will fill an online loan application form. This form consists of details like Sex, Marital 
Status, Qualification, Details of Dependents, Annual Income, Amount of Loan, Credit History of 
the Applicant, and others.

3 Project Description

The objective of this thesis is to investigate which method from a chosen set of machine 
learning techniques performs the best default prediction. The research question is the following

4 Scope of the Work

The loan Status Prediction model will help the Banks, Housing Finance Companies in finding the 
various types of loans like housing loan, personal loan, business loan, etc. is accepted or not. 
And this model will show the status of the loan.
